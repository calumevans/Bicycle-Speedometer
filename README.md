# bicycle-speedometer

This usues a hall switch attached to the bicycle fork and a magnet
attached to the front wheel to detect wheel rotations. This data is 
used to calculate distance, speed, and acceleration.

A quick demo can be seen at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NE9Ll1alJvE

This is all code written by me and feel free to use it but just don't sue me or anything.
