# bicycle-speedometer

This uses a hall sensor (detecting a magnet) attached to the bicycle fork and a magnet
attached to the front wheel to detect wheel rotations. This data is 
used to calculate distance, speed, and acceleration.


The newest version of the speedometer can be seen tested here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzSCPbCqy7k

A first test of the speedometer can be seen here (a very messy prototype) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NE9Ll1alJvE

This is all code written by me and feel free to use it but just don't sue me or anything.
